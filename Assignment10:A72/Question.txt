Design an environment consisting of a single producer class "PROD" and three subscribers viz., iz. "SUB1", "SUB2", and "SUB3". 
Add logic such that the producer broadcasts the name of the coder and all the subscribers are able to receive the string data sent by the producer. 
If Zen is writing the logic, then the producer should broadcast the string "ZEN" and all the subscribers must receive "ZEN".
