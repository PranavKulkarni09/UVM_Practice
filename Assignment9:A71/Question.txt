Send transaction data from COMPA to COMPB with the help of TLM PUT PORT to PUT IMP . 
Transaction class code is added in Instruction tab. Use UVM core print method to print the values of data members of transaction class.

Given Code:

class transaction extends uvm_sequence_item;
 
  bit [3:0] a = 12;
  bit [4:0] b = 24;
  int c = 256;
  
  function new(string inst = "transaction");
    super.new(inst);
  endfunction
  
  
    `uvm_object_utils_begin(transaction)
  `uvm_field_int(a, UVM_DEFAULT | UVM_DEC);
  `uvm_field_int(b, UVM_DEFAULT | UVM_DEC);
  `uvm_field_int(c, UVM_DEFAULT | UVM_DEC); 
    `uvm_object_utils_end
  
  
  
endclass
